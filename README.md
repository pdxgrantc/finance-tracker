# Notes For Myself
## use folders pages, assets, components, utils
1. pages: for the index pages for each route
2. assets: for the static files like images, fonts, etc.
3. components: for the reusable components organized in subfolders with the same name as the page it's used in
4. utils: for the utility functions and constants
